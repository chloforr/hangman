# Hangman

## Overview
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

The coding of the game was implemented in stages, distinguished by each milestone file added to the repository, however the complete game is available in hangman_game.py and will be explained in detail below.

## Installation Instructions

To play the hangman game, download and run the file hangman_game.py.

## Usage Instructions

Upon running the file, a random word is chosen from a list of words. The player is informed of the number of unique characters in the word to be guessed, and a list is displayed with elements '_' for each character of the word: ['_','_',....].

The player enters a letter when prompted with the text "Guess a letter:" and presses enter.





An initial list is stored in the game, of which a random word is automatically picked each time. The user is asked for input of a letter, and the game checks whether the length of the input and whether it is alphabetical. The game then checks whether the letter is contained within the randomised word.
