# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

To install, run the hangman_Template.py file.

An initial list is stored in the game, of which a random word is automatically picked each time. The user is asked for input of a letter, and the game checks whether the length of the input and whether it is alphabetical. The game then checks whether the letter is contained within the randomised word.
